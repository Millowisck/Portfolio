# About me
Hello, my name is Michał Pawłowski and I would like to briefly introduce myself. I became interested in software testing a few years ago and decided to undertake and complete postgraduate studies in "Software Testing" at the University of Management and Computer Science in Rzeszow. In this portfolio I would like to present what I have learned during my studies and how I am currently extending my testing knowledge.
