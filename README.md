# About me
Hello, my name is Michał Pawłowski and I would like to briefly introduce myself. I became interested in software testing a few years ago and decided to undertake and complete postgraduate studies in "Software Testing" at the University of Management and Computer Science in Rzeszow. Now I would like to present what I learned then and what I do now.
